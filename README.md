# Building a Multithreaded Web Server

The multithreaded web server, implemented as in Chapter 20 of The Rust Programming Language book.

## Improvements I want to make

1. ~File-based routing to serve any files in a public directory.~ []()
1. More robust error handling instead of all the `unwrap`s.
