# Building a Multithreaded Web Server

The multithreaded web server, implemented as in Chapter 20 of The Rust Programming Language book.

## Improvements I want to make

1. ~File-based routing to serve any files in a public directory.~ [fa6993c](https://github.com/nixpig/rust-server/commit/fa6993c)
1. More robust error handling instead of all the `unwrap`s.
